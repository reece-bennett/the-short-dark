# The Short Dark

A top-down demake of The Long Dark for Ludum Dare 50. Scavenge buildings for resources, run from wild animals, eat snacks, and donâ€™t get too cold!

Made from scratch with just JavaScript, HTML and CSS!

Make sure to keep an eye on your vital stats in the bottom left corner. Stay inside to warm up, eat and drink to satisfy your hunger and thirst. Your health will replenish over time if you have food to spare. Sprinting allows you to move faster with the trade-off of consuming food and water quicker. 

Bears will attack if you get too close - keep your distance! 

All objects in the game are rendered using divs and CSS for positioning - this can be taxing on system resources, especially on lower powered devices. If you are struggling for performance resizing the browser window smaller should help a bit.
